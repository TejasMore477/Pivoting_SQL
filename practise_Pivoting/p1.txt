1️⃣ Problem: Pivoting Sales Data by Months
Scenario:
You have a table named sales that records sales made by different employees in different months.

Table Schema (sales):
employee	month	sales_amount
Alice	    Jan	    5000
Alice	    Feb	    7000
Bob	        Jan	    6000
Bob	        Mar	    8000
Charlie	    Feb	    6500

Task:
Pivot the table to display employees as rows and months as columns with sales values.

Expected Output:
employee	Jan	    Feb	    Mar
Alice	    5000	7000	NULL
Bob	        6000	NULL	8000
Charlie	    NULL	6500	NULL

Hint for Query:
Use CASE statements and MAX() to pivot sales data.
