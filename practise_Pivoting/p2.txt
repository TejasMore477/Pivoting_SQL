2️⃣ Problem: Pivoting Employee Work Shifts
Scenario:
You have a table named work_shifts that records the shift (Morning, Evening, Night) of employees on different days.

Table Schema (work_shifts):
employee	day	        shift
Alice	    Monday	    Morning
Alice	    Tuesday	    Evening
Bob	        Monday	    Night
Bob	        Wednesday	Morning
Charlie	    Tuesday	    Night


Task:
Pivot the table to display employees as rows and days as columns with shift values.

Expected Output:
employee	Monday	 Tuesday	 Wednesday
Alice	    Morning	 Evening    NULL
Bob	        Night	 NULL	    Morning
Charlie	    NULL	 Night	    NULL

Hint for Query:
Use CASE statements inside MAX() and group by employee.
